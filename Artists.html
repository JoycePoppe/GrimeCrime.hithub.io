								<p>
                  Grime Crime is a rappers collective consisting of 4 grime artists. They all have a criminal past that they still express in their music. Nowadays they are on the right track (please be told), but that does not mean that they want to forget their criminal past. It has had an important impact on their lives, and certainly on their music. They started Grime Crime to respond to the system with music instead of violence / crime as before.</p>
